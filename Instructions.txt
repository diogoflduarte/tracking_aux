1. Download openCV source (3.0.0 for now)






2. place the extracted folder in some directory (mine is under C:\opencv\opencv_joaofayad)






3. set the following variables in windows environment:

OPENCV_DIR32 = C:\opencv\opencv_joaofayad\build\x64\vc12
OPENCV_DIR64 = C:\opencv\opencv_joaofayad\build\x64\vc12
OPENCV_DIR = C:\opencv\opencv_joaofayad\build\x64\vc12

And add %OPENCV_DIR%\bin to user path






4. Create new project in Visual Studio:
Visual C++  ->  console application  ->  empty project







5. Open the project properties by right clicking the project name (in the solution explorer area)

		
5.1. FOR RELEASE (dropbown menu)
	Target platform -> 8.1, Platform toolset -> Visual Studio 2015 (v140)
	Condiguration Type -> Application(.exe), Character set -> Use Unicode char set
	
	 FOR DEBUGGING
	Target platform -> 8.1, Platform toolset -> Visual Studio 2015 (v140)
	Condiguration Type -> Application(.exe), Character set -> Use Unicode char set, Whole Program Optimization -> Use link time code generation

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
6. Change definitions for debug mode (configuration dropdown menu)

6.1 C/C++ aditional include directories:
	Add '$(OPENCV_DIR)\..\..\include' (without the apostrophes)
	Add locomouse subfolders in the following order, top to bottom:
		'Locomouse_Core', 'MyMat', 'match2nd', 'Candidates'
	Warning level -> Level3 (/W3)
	SDL checks -> Yes (/sdl)
	
6.2 C/C++ Optimization -> Disabled (/Od)
	
6.3 C/C++ Preprocessor, Preprocessor definitions:
			_DEBUG
			_CONSOLE
			_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
	
6.4 Linker general,  add '$(OPENCV_DIR)\lib' to additional library directories.
	Linker general, enable incremental linking -> Yes (/INCREMENTAL) 

6.5 Linker input, add 'opencv_ts300d.lib' and opencv_world300d.lib to additional dependencies.
Note: I think 300 stands for version 3.0.0, so it's likely to change with version. d stands for debug, 
      and there's and answer in a stack overflow thread which recommends using 'd' only for debugging.
	  
6.6 Linker debugging, Generate debug info -> true
	  
6.7 Linker System, SubSystem -> Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)
	  
6.8 Linker advanced, target platform should be machine x64
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  

	  
7.  Change definitions for release mode
7.1 C/C++ aditional include directories:
	Add '$(OPENCV_DIR)\..\..\include' (without the apostrophes)
	Add locomouse subfolders in the following order, top to bottom:
		'Locomouse_Core', 'MyMat', 'match2nd', 'Candidates'
	Warning level -> Level3 (/W3)
	SDL checks -> Yes (/sdl)
	
7.2 C/C++ Optimization -> Maximize speed (/O2). Enable intrinsic functions -> Yes (/Oi)
	
7.3  C/C++ Preprocessor, Preprocessor definitions: 
		_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
		NDEBUG
		_CONSOLE
		
7.4  C/C++ Code generation, Runtime Library -> Multi-threaded (/MT)
		Enable function level linking -> Yes (/Gy)
	
7.5 Linker general, add '$(OPENCV_DIR)\lib' to additional library directories.
	Linker general, enable incremental linking -> No (/INCREMENTAL:NO)

7.6 Linker input, add 'opencv_ts300.lib' and opencv_world300.lib to additional dependencies.
	(without the 'd' suffix)

7.7 Linker debugging, Generate debug info -> true

7.8 Linker System, SubSystem -> Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

7.9 Linker advanced, target platform should be machine x64






8. Make sure build is at x64 bit:
	Build tab, Configuration manager, x64 (instead of x86)




For some reason I had to restart visual studio once so that everything (hello world) would work
